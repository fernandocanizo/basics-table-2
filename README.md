# basics-table-2

A throwaway project to test hyperhtml import/version related stuff.

This demo https://stackblitz.com/edit/basics-table-2 , from Iv√°n Torres (aka
https://stackblitz.com/@pinguxx), works fine.

However, when I download the project and try it locally, it doesn't work.

So I'm starting with the files from that project and fixing stuff into this pet
project in order to learn what's going on.

## Run

```
# install and http server
npm i -g http-server

# then, standing on this project root path
http-server -p 3333 .
```
